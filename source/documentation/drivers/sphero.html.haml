  %section.intro
    =image_tag "/images/sphero.jpg", class: "display"
    %p
      Allows user to interact with the Sphero robotic sphero using Artoo.

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
    %p
      That is pretty simple once the Sphero is ready (connected and listening), you just need three lines of code and you are set,
      Artoo and the Sphero driver take care of the rest.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'
          connection :sphero, :adaptor => :sphero, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
          device :sphero, :driver => :sphero

  %section.public-methods
    %h2 Public instance methods:

    %h3 roll(speed, direction) → true | nil
    %p
      Starts the sphero rolling at the provided speed (value between 0 and 255) and direction (value between 0 and 360).

    %h3 stop → true | nil
    %p
      Stops the sphero.

    %h3 detect_collissions → true | nil
    %p
      REVISION PENDING: Sets the sphero to detect collisions and report them.

    %h3 messages → [sphero_event]
    %p
      REVISION PENDING: Returns an array of sphero events, the messages reported by the sphero.

    %h3 color(:color_symbol | [red, green, blue]) → [red_int, green_int, blue_int]
    %p
      REVISION PENDING: You can pass a color as a symbol or an array containing RGB colors from 0 to 255 ([255, 0, 0] == red),
      if passed a symbol returns the array of RGB corresponding to the color, if passed an array of colors it returns the same array 
      (used when setting colors to the sphero).

    %h3 set_color([red, green, blue]) → true | nil
    %p
      REVISION PENDING: You can either use it in tandem with color to set the color of the sphero or just pass an array containing RGB colors
      on the range 0 to 255 ([255, 0, 0] == red).

  %section.public-events
    %h2 Public driver events:
    %p
      Public events are triggered when something occurs to your sphero, when this occurs you can execute some code 
      to respond accordingly, depending on the event triggered, you can access
      the following public events when programming the Sphero.

    %h3 :colission
    %p
      Gets triggered when the sphero hits something or falls from a step.

    %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
    %p
      Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above)
      you can call events on the sphero driver as follows:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          # :contact is the name of a previously defined method containing the code to execute.
          on sphero, :collision => :contact

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to use
    %h3 Example to roll the sphero in a random direction and change direction every 3 seconds.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'

          connection :sphero, :adaptor => :sphero, :port => '127.0.0.1:4567'
          device :sphero, :driver => :sphero

          work do
            @rolling = false

            every(3.seconds) do
              puts "Rolling..."
              unless @rolling
                sphero.roll 90, rand(360)
                @rolling = true
              else
                sphero.stop
                @rolling = false
              end
            end
          end

  %section.compatability.hardware
    %h2 Works with:
