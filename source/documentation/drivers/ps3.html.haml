    :markdown
          :::ruby
          on joystick, :joystick => proc { |caller, value|
            puts 'joystick ' + value[:s].to_s, value[:x], value[:y]
          }

          work do
            on joystick, :joystick => proc { |caller, value|
              puts 'joystick ' + value[:s].to_s, value[:x], value[:y]
            }
            on joystick, :button_triangle => proc { |*value|
              puts 'triangle button'
            }
          end
