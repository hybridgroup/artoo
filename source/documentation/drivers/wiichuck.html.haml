  %p Allows user to use a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck controller via i2c interface

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
  %h3 For Arduino:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0'
        device :wiichuck, :driver => :wiichuck, :connection :arduino

%section.public-methods
  %h2 Events:
  %table.commands 
    %tr 
      %th Event
      %th Description
    %tr 
      %td.command 
        %span c_button
      %td Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the square button is pressed.
    %tr 
      %td.command 
        %span z_button
      %td Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the square button is pressed.
    %tr 
      %td.command 
        %span joystick
      %td 
        Get's triggered every "interval" amount of time if a joystick event occured, you can access values 
        %span x, y.

  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on wiichuck, :c_button => proc { puts "c button pressed!" }

%section.how_to
  %h2 Example using a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :wiichuck, :driver => :wiichuck, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.1

        work do
          on wiichuck, :c_button => proc { puts "c button pressed!" }
          on wiichuck, :z_button => proc { puts "z button pressed!" }
          on wiichuck, :joystick => proc { |*value|
            puts "joystick x: " + value[1][:x] + ", y: " + value[1][:y]
          }
        end
