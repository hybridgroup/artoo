  %h2 How To Connect
  %h3 For Arduino:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0'
        device :compass, :driver => :hmc_6352_compass, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.5

%section.how-to#HowToUse
  %h2 How To Use
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on compass, :heading => proc { |caller, data| puts "heading: \#{data}"}
        
  
  %h3 Example using a HMC6352 Digital Compass.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0'
        device :compass, :driver => :hmc_6352_compass, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.5

        work do
          on compass, :heading => proc { |caller, data| puts "heading: \#{data}"}
