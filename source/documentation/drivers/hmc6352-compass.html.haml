%section.intro
  =image_tag "/images/devices/hmc6352-compass.jpg", class: "display"
  %p Allows user to read heading from HMC6352 Digital Compass via i2c interface

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
  %h3 For Arduino:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0'
        device :compass, :driver => :hmc_6352_compass, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.5

  .commands_api
    = partial "/documentation/drivers/partials/i2c/events_hmc"

  %h2 Commands:
  %table.commands 
    %tr 
      %th Command (param)
      %th Description
    %tr 
      %td.command heading → float
      %td.param  
        %p  Returns the heading data for the compass.
        %h5 Params
        %span no params
        %h5 Returns 
        %span float

  
%section.public-events
  %h2 Events:
  %table.commands 
    %tr 
      %th Event
      %th Description
    %tr 
      %td.command 
        %span heading
      %td Gets triggered every time the specified interval is met.

  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on compass, :heading => proc { |caller, data| puts "heading: \#{data}"}

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to use
  %h3 Example using a HMC6352 Digital Compass.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0'
        device :compass, :driver => :hmc_6352_compass, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.5

        work do
          on compass, :heading => proc { |caller, data| puts "heading: \#{data}"}
        end
