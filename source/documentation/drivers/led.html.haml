    %p
      Allows user to interact with LEDs through digital output and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to stablish a connection and setup the driver
    %h3 For Arduino:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'
          connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
          device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

    %h3 For Digispark:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'
          connection :digispark, :adaptor => :littlewire, :vendor => 0x1781, :product => 0x0c9f
          device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

  %section.public-methods
    %h2 Public instance methods:

    %h3 on → true | nil
    %p
      Turns LED on.

    %h3 off → true | nil
    %p
      Turns LED off.

    %h3 on? → true | false
    %p
      Returns true if LED is on, otherwise returns false.

    %h3 off? → true | false
    %p
      Returns true if LED is off, otherwise returns false.

    %h3 toggle → true | nil
    %p
      Turns the LED on, or off, depending on if it is already off, or on, respectively.

    %h3 brightness(brightness_int) → true | nil
    %p
      Sets brightness of the led to the specified brightness value passed to brightness(brightness_int) using PWM,
      brightness can be any integer value between 0 and 255.

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to use
    %h3 Example using a button to turn a LED on and off.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'

          #connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/tty*'
          connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
          device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

          work do
            every 1.second do
              led.on? ? led.off : led.on
            end
