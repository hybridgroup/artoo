      Allows user to use a Nintendo Wii Classic Controller via i2c interface

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
    %h3 For Arduino:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'
          connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
          device :wiiclassic, :driver => :wiiclassic, :connection :arduino

    %h3 For Digispark:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'
          connection :digispark, :adaptor => :littlewire, :vendor => 0x1781, :product => 0x0c9f
          device :wiiclassic, :driver => :wiiclassic, :connection :digispark

  %section.public-methods
    %h2 Public driver events:
    %h3 a_button
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the a button is pressed.

    %h3 b_button
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the b button is pressed.

    %h3 x_button
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the x button is pressed.

    %h3 y_button
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the y button is pressed.

    %h3 home_button
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the home button is pressed.

    %h3 select_button
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the select button (-) is pressed.

    %h3 start_button
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the start button (+) is pressed.

    %h3 right_trigger
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the right trigger button is pressed, makes right trigger value available.

    %h3 left_trigger
    %p
      Get's triggered every interval amount of time if the left trigger button is pressed, makes left trigger value available.

    %h3 left_joystick
    %p
      Get's triggered every "interval" amount of time if a left joystick event occured, you can access values x, y.

    %h3 right_joystick
    %p
      Get's triggered every "interval" amount of time if a right joystick event occured, you can access values x, y.

    %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
    %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          on wiiclassic, :a_button => proc { puts "a button pressed!" }

    %h2 How to use
    %h3 Example using a Nintendo Wii Classic Controller comming soon.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'

          connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => "127.0.0.1:8023"
          device :wiiclassic, :driver => :wiiclassic, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.1

          work do
            on wiiclassic, :a_button => proc { puts "c button pressed!" }
            on wiiclassic, :b_button => proc { puts "z button pressed!" }
            on wiiclassic, :left_joystick => proc { |*value|
              puts "joystick x: " + value[1][:x] + ", y: " + value[1][:y]
            }
          end
