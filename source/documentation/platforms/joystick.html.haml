    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program receives joystick and button press events from an XBox 360 game controller.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'

          connection :joystick, :adaptor => :joystick
          device :joystick, :driver => :xbox360, :connection => :joystick, :interval => 0.1

          work do
            on controller, :joystick => proc { |*value|
              puts "joystick \#{value[1][:s]} x:\#{value[1][:x]} y:\#{value[1][:y]}"
            }
            on controller, :button_a => proc { |*value|
              puts "ayyyy!"
            }
            on controller, :button_b => proc { |*value|
              puts "bee!"
            }
            on controller, :button_x => proc { |*value|
              puts "exxx!"
