    %h4 What is Sphero?
    %p  Sphero is a sophisticated and programmable robot housed in a polycarbonate sphere shell.
    %p  The artoo-sphero adaptor makes it easy to interact with Sphero using Ruby, once you have your Sphero setup and connected to your computer you can start writing code to make Sphero move, change direction, speed and colors, or detect Sphero events and execute some code when they occur.
    %h4 Where can I get a Sphero or find more info about it?
    %p
      You can do it by following this link

%section.how-to#HowToInstall
  %h2 How To Install
  %p Installing artoo with sphero support is pretty easy using ruby gems.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        gem install artoo-sphero
  %p Afterwards you need to install <em>socat</em> - for this please run the following command (works on both OSX and Linux):
  :markdown
        :::bash
        artoo install socat

%section.how-to#HowToUse
  %h2 How To Use
  %p Example of a simple program that makes the Sphero roll and change colors.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
         require 'artoo'

        connection :sphero, :adaptor => :sphero, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :sphero, :driver => :sphero

        work do
          @count = 1
          every(3.seconds) do
            sphero.set_color(@count % 2 == 0 ? :green : :blue)
            @count += 1
            sphero.roll 60, rand(360)
          end
        end

%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  %h2 How To Connect
  %h3 OSX
  %p The main steps are:
  %ul
    %li Pair your computer and the Sphero
    %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
    %li Connect to the device via Artoo
  %p First pair your computer and Sphero. You might be prompted for a passcode, but you do not need to enter it, sinec the Sphero does not check.
  %p Once paired, use the "artoo connect scan" command to find out your connection info:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ artoo bluetooth scan
  %p Now you are ready to connect to the Sphero using the socket, in this example port 8023:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        artoo bluetooth connect Sphero-WRW 8023
  %h3 Ubuntu
  %p The main steps are:
  %ul
    %li Find out the sphero bluetooth address
    %li Pair your computer and the Sphero
    %li Map your device to a unix port
    %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
    %li Connect to the device via Artoo
  %p
    First pair your computer and Sphero. We do this by finding the sphero bluetooth address
    and then running the `artoo bluetooth pair` command, you might be prompted to confirm a passcode,
    just accept whatever passcode prompted.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ artoo bluetooth scan
        Scanning ...
          00:06:66:4A:14:99 Sphero-WRW
  %p
    After finding the bluetooth address, we pair the device with the computer.
    The easiest way to do this is to use the `artoo bluetooth pair` command:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        artoo bluetooth pair 00:06:66:4A:14:99

  %p
    Next, you need to bind the Sphero to the system serial port. In the above
    example, /dev/Sphero-WRW. Use the `artoo bluetooth bind` command:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        artoo bluetooth bind 00:06:66:4A:14:99 Sphero-WRW

  %p Now you are ready to connect to the Sphero using the socket, in this example port 8023:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        artoo bluetooth connect Sphero-WRW 8023
