    %h2 How to install
    %p
      Installing artoo with pebble support is pretty easy using ruby gems.
    :markdown
          :::bash
          gem install artoo-pebble
    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program receives button press events from a Pebble smart watch.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'

          connection :pebble, :adaptor => :pebble, :port => "/dev/rfcomm0", :id => "378B"
          device :watch, :driver => :pebble

          work do
            on watch, :media_control => :button_push
          end

          def button_push(caller, data)
            puts data.button unless data.nil?
          end
    %h2 How to connect
    %p This software requires version 1.12.0 of the Pebble watch firmware.

    %h3 OSX

    %p The main steps are:

    %ul
      %li Pair your computer and the Pebble
      %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local port
      %li Connect to the device via Artoo
      %li To figure out which port your pebble is connected to, use the artoo connect scan command:

    :markdown
          :::bash
          $ artoo connect scan

    %p Now you are ready to connect to the Sphero using the socket, in this example port 4567:

    :markdown
          :::bash
          artoo connect serial 4567 pebble

    %h3 Ubuntu

    %p The main steps are:

    %ul
      %li Pair your computer and the Pebble
      %li Map your device to a port
      %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local port
      %li Connect to the device via Artoo
      %li You will need to pair with the Pebble, entering any needed password.

    %p Then you can find the Bluetooth address, for example 00:18:33:86:37:8B, by using the artoo connect scan command:

    :markdown
          :::bash
          $ artoo connect scan

    %p Once you know the address, you can use the artoo connect bind command to map a port to the device:

    :markdown
          :::bash
          artoo connect bind 00:18:33:86:37:8B pebble

    %p Now you are ready to connect to the Pebble using a socket, in this example port 4567:

    :markdown
          :::bash
          artoo connect socat pebble 4567
