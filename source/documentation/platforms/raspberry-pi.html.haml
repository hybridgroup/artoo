    %p The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and popular ARM based single board computer with digital & PWM GPIO, and i2c interfaces built in.

    %p

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to install
    %p If you do not have ruby installed, you'll need to do that first.
    %p
      Then install the artoo-raspi gem:
    :markdown
          :::bash
          sudo gem install artoo-raspi

    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program causes an LED to blink.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'artoo'

          connection :raspi, :adaptor => :raspi
          device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 11

          work do
            every 1.second do
              led.toggle
            end
          end
    %p To run the examples, requires sudo access on the Raspberry Pi:

    :markdown
          :::bash
          sudo ruby examples/raspi_led.rb

    %h2 How to connect
    %h3 Connecting to Raspberry Pi GPIO
    %p
      This gem only works on a real Raspberry Pi. Do not bother trying on any other kind of
      computer it will not work. Also note you will need to connect actual circuits to the Raspberry Pi's
      GPIO pins.

    %h3 Enabling the Raspberry Pi i2c on raspbian
    %p You must add these two entries in your /etc/modules

    :markdown
          :::bash
          i2c-bcm2708
          i2c-dev

    %p You must also ensure that these entries are commented in your /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

    :markdown
          :::bash
          #blacklist spi-bcm2708
          #blacklist i2c-bcm2708

    %p Now restart your raspberry pi.

    %h3 Enabling PWM output on GPIO pins.

    %p
      You need to install and have pi-blaster running in the raspberry-pi, you can follow
      the instructions for pi-blaster install on our repo here:

    %a{ href:"https://github.com/hybridgroup/pi-blaster" } https://github.com/hybridgroup/pi-blaster

  %section.drivers
    %h2 Drivers
    %p All Artoo digital and PWM GPIO, and i2c drivers listed below should work with the Raspberry Pi:
