  %section.how-to

    :markdown
          :::bash
          gem install artoo-ardrone

    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program lets the ARDrone take-off, hover, and land.

    :markdown
          :::ruby

          require 'artoo'

          connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone, :port => '192.168.0.43:5556'
          device :drone, :driver => :ardrone, :connection => :ardrone

          work do
            drone.start
            drone.take_off

            after(25.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
            after(30.seconds) { drone.stop }
          end
    %h2 How to connect
    %p
      The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a
      connection to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones,
      you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.
